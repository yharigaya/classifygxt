	abstract = {Genetic studies often seek to establish a causal chain of events originating from genetic variation through to molecular and clinical phenotypes. When multiple phenotypes share a common genetic association, one phenotype may act as an intermediate for the genetic effects on the other. Alternatively, the phenotypes may be causally unrelated but share genetic loci. Mediation analysis represents a class of causal inference approaches used to determine which of these scenarios is most plausible. We have developed a general approach to mediation analysis based on Bayesian model selection and have implemented it in an R package, bmediatR. Bayesian model selection provides a flexible framework that can be tailored to different analyses. Our approach can incorporate prior information about the likelihood of models and the strength of causal effects. It can also accommodate multiple genetic variants or multi-state haplotypes. Our approach reports posterior probabilities that can be useful in interpreting uncertainty among competing models. We compared bmediatR with other popular methods, including the Sobel test, Mendelian randomization, and Bayesian network analysis using simulated data. We found that bmediatR performed as well or better than these alternatives in most scenarios. We applied bmediatR to proteome data from Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, a multi-parent population, and demonstrate the power of mediation with multi-state haplotypes. We also applied bmediatR to data from human cell lines to identify transcripts that are mediated through or are expressed independently from local chromatin accessibility. We demonstrate that Bayesian model selection provides a powerful and versatile approach to identify causal relationships in genetic studies using model organism or human data.},

	title = {Inferring cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks during human neurogenesis},
	abstract = {Background:  Genetic variation influences both chromatin accessibility, assessed in chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) studies, and gene expression, assessed in expression QTL (eQTL) studies. Genetic variants can impact either nearby genes (cis-eQTLs) or distal genes (trans-eQTLs). Colocalization between caQTL and eQTL, or cis- and trans-eQTLs suggests that they share causal variants. However, pairwise colocalization between these molecular QTLs does not guarantee a causal relationship. Mediation analysis can be applied to assess the evidence supporting causality versus independence between molecular QTLs. Given that the function of QTLs can be cell-type-specific, we performed mediation analyses to find epigenetic and distal regulatory causal pathways for genes within two major cell types of the developing human cortex, progenitors and neurons.
Results:  We find that the expression of 168 and 38 genes is mediated by chromatin accessibility in progenitors and neurons, respectively. We also find that the expression of 11 and 12 downstream genes is mediated by upstream genes in progenitors and neurons. Moreover, we discover that a genetic locus associated with inter-individual differences in brain structure shows evidence for mediation of SLC26A7 through chromatin accessibility, identifying molecular mechanisms of a common variant association to a brain trait.
Conclusions:  In this study, we identify cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks whereby the impacts of variants on gene expression were mediated by chromatin accessibility or distal gene expression. Identification of these causal paths will enable identifying and prioritizing actionable regulatory targets perturbing these key processes during neurodevelopment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Gene regulatory effects in bulk-post mortem brain tissues are undetected at many non-coding brain trait-associated loci. We hypothesized that context-specific genetic variant function during stimulation of a developmental signaling pathway would explain additional regulatory mechanisms. We measured chromatin accessibility and gene expression following activation of the canonical Wnt pathway in primary human neural progenitors from 82 donors. TCF/LEF motifs, brain structure-, and neuropsychiatric disorder-associated variants were enriched within Wnt-responsive regulatory elements (REs). Genetically influenced REs were enriched in genomic regions under positive selection along the human lineage. Stimulation of the Wnt pathway increased the detection of genetically influenced REs/genes by 66.2\%/52.7\%, and led to the identification of 397 REs primed for effects on gene expression. Context-specific molecular quantitative trait loci increased brain-trait colocalizations by up to 70\%, suggesting that genetic variant effects during early neurodevelopmental patterning lead to differences in adult brain and behavioral traits.},

	abstract = {The study of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) is an important problem in genomics and biomedicine. While detection (testing) of eQTL associations has been widely studied, less work has been devoted to the estimation of eQTL eﬀect size. To reduce false positives, detection methods frequently rely on linear modeling of rank-based normalized or log-transformed gene expression data. Unfortunately, these approaches do not correspond to the simplest model of eQTL action, and thus yield estimates of eQTL association that can be uninterpretable and inaccurate. In this article, we propose a new, log-of-linear model for eQTL action, termed ACME, that captures allelic contributions to cis-acting eQTLs in an additive fashion, yielding eﬀect size estimates that correspond to a biologically coherent model of cis-eQTLs. We describe a non-linear least-squares algorithm to ﬁt the model by maximum likelihood, and obtain corresponding p-values. We perform careful investigation of the model using a combination of simulated data and data from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our results reveal little evidence for dominance eﬀects, a parsimonious result that accords with a simple biological model for allele-speciﬁc expression and supports use of the ACME model. We show that Type-I error is wellcontrolled under our approach in a realistic setting, so that rank-based normalizations are unnecessary. Furthermore, we show that such normalizations can be detrimental to power and estimation accuracy under the proposed model. We then show, through eﬀect size analyses of whole-genome cis-eQTLs in the GTEx data, that using standard normalizations instead of ACME noticeably aﬀects the ranking and sign of estimates.},

	abstract = {RNA-seq may replace gene expression microarrays in the near future. Using RNA-seq, the expression of a gene can be estimated using the total number of sequence reads mapped to that gene, known as the total read count (TReC). Traditional expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping methods, such as linear regression, can be applied to TReC measurements after they are properly normalized. In this article, we show that eQTL mapping, by directly modeling TReC using discrete distributions, has higher statistical power than the two-step approach: data normalization followed by linear regression. In addition, RNA-seq provides information on allele-speciﬁc expression (ASE) that is not available from microarrays. By combining the information from TReC and ASE, we can computationally distinguish cis- and trans-eQTL and further improve the power of cis-eQTL mapping. Both simulation and real data studies conﬁrm the improved power of our new methods. We also discuss the design issues of RNA-seq experiments. Speciﬁcally, we show that by combining TReC and ASE measurements, it is possible to minimize cost and retain the statistical power of cis-eQTL mapping by reducing sample size while increasing the number of sequence reads per sample. In addition to RNA-seq data, our method can also be employed to study the genetic basis of other types of sequencing data, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing data. In this article, we focus on eQTL mapping of a single gene using the association-based method. However, our method establishes a statistical framework for future developments of eQTL mapping methods using RNA-seq data (e.g., linkage-based eQTL mapping), and the joint study of multiple genetic markers and/or multiple genes.},

However, few benchmark studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy of the various methods developed for this purpose.
Results:  Here we benchmark popular hidden variable inference methods including surrogate variable analysis (SVA), probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER), and hidden covariates with prior (HCP) against principal component analysis (PCA)—a well-established dimension reduction and factor discovery method—via 362 synthetic and 110 real data sets. We show that PCA not only underlies the statistical methodology behind the popular methods but is also orders of magnitude faster, better-performing, and much easier to interpret and use.
Conclusions:  To help researchers use PCA in their QTL analysis, we provide an R package PCAForQTL along with a detailed guide, both of which are freely available at https://github.com/heatherjzhou/PCAForQTL. We believe that using PCA rather than SVA, PEER, or HCP will substantially improve and simplify hidden variable inference in QTL mapping as well as increase the transparency and reproducibility of QTL research.},

We show that aFC estimates independently derived from eQTL and allelic expression data are highly consistent, and identify technical and biological correlates of eQTL effect size. We generalize aFC to analyze genes with two eQTLs in GTEx and show that in nearly all cases the two eQTLs act independently in regulating gene expression. In summary, aFC is a solid measure of

By characterizing the cellular context, this study illustrates how genetic variants that operate in a cell type–specific manner affect gene regulation and can be linked to complex traits. This deconvolution and analysis of cell types from bulk tissues allows greater precision in understanding how phenotypes are linked to genetic variation.

              INTRODUCTION
              Efforts to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across human tissues by the GTEx Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing QTLs (eQTLs and sQTLs, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a QTL is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type–specific QTLs from bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to GTEx tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits.
            
            
              RATIONALE
              A growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type–specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the GTEx project to map QTLs that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type–interaction QTLs for expression and splicing (ieQTLs and isQTLs, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Using 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes with an ieQTL and 987 genes with an isQTL (at 5\% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the QTLs for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from eQTL heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type–interaction QTLs for patterns of tissue sharing and found that ieQTLs are enriched for genes with tissue-specific eQTLs and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific eQTLs originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the ieQTLs and isQTLs for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type–interaction QTLs are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of {\textgreater}50\% over colocalizations with standard QTLs. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard QTLs.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              The ieQTLs and isQTLs identified for seven cell types across GTEx tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type–specific QTLs remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type–specific QTLs will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping QTLs in single cells.
              
                
                  Detection of cell type–specific effects on gene expression.
                  The enrichment of seven cell types is calculated across GTEx tissues, enabling mapping of cell type–interaction QTLs for expression and splicing by testing for significant interactions between genotypes and cell type enrichments. Linking these QTLs to complex trait associations enables discovery of {\textgreater}50\% more colocalizations compared with standard QTLs and reveals the cellular specificity of traits.

            The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has identified expression and splicing quantitative trait loci in cis (QTLs) for the majority of genes across a wide range of human tissues. However, the functional characterization of these QTLs has been limited by the heterogeneous cellular composition of GTEx tissue samples. We mapped interactions between computational estimates of cell type abundance and genotype to identify cell type–interaction QTLs for seven cell types and show that cell type–interaction expression QTLs (eQTLs) provide finer resolution to tissue specificity than bulk tissue cis-eQTLs. Analyses of genetic associations with 87 complex traits show a contribution from cell type–interaction QTLs and enables the discovery of hundreds of previously unidentified colocalized loci that are masked in bulk tissue.},

However, the presence of many SNPs with detectable marginal effects on the trait of interest can reduce power by “displacing” true interactions with weaker marginal effects and by adding to the number of tests that need to be corrected for multiple testing. We introduce a new significance‐based allocation into bins for Step‐2 G × E testing that overcomes the displacement issue and propose a computationally efficient approach to account for multiple testing within bins. Simulation results demonstrate that these simple improvements can provide substantially greater power than current methods under several scenarios. An application to a multistudy collaboration for understanding colorectal cancer reveals a G × Sex interaction located near the SMAD7 gene.},

We used extensive, empirically driven simulations to explore eQTL study design and the performance of various analysis strategies. Across multiple testing correction methods, false discoveries of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) were substantially inﬂated when false discovery rate (FDR) control was applied to all tests and only appropriately controlled using hierarchical procedures. All multiple testing correction procedures had low power and inﬂated FDR for eGenes whose causal SNPs had small allele frequencies using small sample sizes (e.g. frequency {\textless}10\% in 100 samples), indicating that even moderately low frequency eQTL SNPs (eSNPs) in these studies are enriched for false discoveries. In scenarios with ≥80\% power, the top eSNP was the true simulated eSNP 90\% of the time, but substantially less frequently for very common eSNPs (minor allele frequencies {\textgreater}25\%). Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes, so-called ‘Winner’s Curse’, was common in low and moderate power settings. To address this, we developed a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) that led to more accurate effect size estimation. These insights provide a foundation for future eQTL studies, especially those with sampling constraints and subtly different conditions.},

              Some human genetic variants affect the amount of RNA produced and the splicing of gene transcripts, crucial steps in development and maintaining a healthy individual. However, some of these changes only occur in a small number of tissues within the body. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has been expanded over time, and, looking at the final data in version 8, Aguet
              et al.
              present a deep characterization of genetic associations and gene expression and splicing in 838 individuals over 49 tissues (see the Perspective by Wilson). This large study was able to characterize the details underlying many aspects of gene expression and provides a resource with which to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants affect gene regulation and complex traits in humans.

            The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations. Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.},

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines remains unclear. We created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24 hr exposure to varying doxorubicin dosages. The transcriptomic response is substantial: the majority of genes are differentially expressed and over 6000 genes show evidence of differential splicing, the later driven by reduced splicing fidelity in the presence of doxorubicin. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of in vitro cell damage, which in turn is associated with in vivo ACT risk. We detect 447 response-expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 42 response-splicing QTLs, which are enriched in lower ACT GWAS

          , 
            Many cancers, including leukaemia, lymphoma and breast cancer, are treated with potent chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines. However, anthracyclines have strong side effects known as anthracycline cardiotoxicity, which affect the health of the heart. Almost half of the patients given high doses of anthracyclines develop chronic heart failure.
            While anthracycline cardiotoxicity is very common, people’s genes may contribute to how sensitive they are to these drugs but it is not understood which genes can cause this effect. Previous studies using only a small number of participants have not been able to pin down the genetic factors that make some patients respond well to anthracyclines, and others prone to developing heart failure when taking these drugs.
            To find out which genes affect anthracycline cardiotoxicity, Knowles, Burrows et al. transformed blood cells from 45 individuals into stem cells, which were then developed into heart muscle cells. Then, the activity of genes was analyzed by measuring the amount of RNA (the template molecules used to make proteins) produced by those genes.
            After the cells had been exposed for 24 hours to the anthracycline drug doxorubicin, hundreds of gene activity differences could be found in the heart muscle cells between individuals. Some of these differences were linked to poorer health of the cells after treatment with the drug. As a result, a number of genetic variants that could predispose patients to the side effects of doxorubicin were discovered. The experiments also revealed how doxorubicin disrupts an important process that separates ‘junk’ parts of the RNA from the parts that are used as a template for proteins.
            Being able to predict who is likely to be sensitive to drugs such as doxorubicin could help doctors to tailor chemotherapy treatments more effectively, minimising the risk of heart failure. In future, larger studies could lead to accurate predictions of a patient’s response to a particular chemotherapy drug to personalize their cancer treatment.},

Recently, inverse normal transformations (INTs) have gained popularity among genetics researchers and are implemented as an option in several software packages. Despite this increasing use, we are unaware of extensive simulations or mathematical proofs showing that INTs have desirable statistical properties in the context of genetic studies. We show that INTs do not necessarily maintain proper Type 1 error control and can also reduce statistical power in some circumstances. Many alternatives to INTs exist. Therefore, we contend that there is a lack of justification for performing parametric statistical procedures on INTs with the exceptions of simple designs with moderate to large sample sizes, which makes permutation testing computationally infeasible and where maximum likelihood testing is used. Rigorous research evaluating the utility of INTs seems warranted.},

Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called eigenMT, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that eigenMT can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for eQTL discovery.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new framework for the analysis of association studies, designed to allow untyped variants to be more effectively and directly tested for association with a phenotype. The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate ("impute") unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies.

Up to now eQTL studies have been conducted in a relatively narrow range of tissues or cell types. However, understanding the biology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in multiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of cell types. Here we present a statistical framework for powerfully detecting eQTLs in multiple tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple subgroups). The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to be active in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling the sharing of active eQTLs among tissues, this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that are present in more than one tissue compared with "tissue-by-tissue" analyses that examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of eQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared across different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model, addressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing overlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our framework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts, we find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue analysis, identifying 63\% more genes with eQTLs (at FDR = 0.05). Further, the results suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of the same data, the majority of eQTLs detectable in these data are shared among all three tissues.},

              Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in innate immunity. Apart from their function in host defense, dysregulation in TLR signalling can confer risk to autoimmune diseases, septic shock or cancer. Here we report genetic variants and transcripts that are active only during TLR signalling and contribute to interindividual differences in immune response. Comparing unstimulated versus TLR4-stimulated monocytes reveals 1,471 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that are unique to TLR4 stimulation. Among these we find functional SNPs for the expression of
              NEU4
              ,
              CCL14

            Lithium is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder (BD) and is known to increase neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation. Though the mechanism of lithium’s therapeutic effect is not understood, evidence suggests that genetic variation influences response to treatment. Here, we used a library of genetically diverse human NPCs to identify common genetic variants that modulate lithium induced proliferation. We identified a locus on chr3p21.1 associated with lithium induced proliferation that colocalizes with BD risk. One lithium responsive gene,
            GNL3
            , was detected within the locus. The allele associated with increased baseline and lithium-induced

            GNL3
            was necessary for lithium’s full proliferative effects, and sufficient to induce proliferation without lithium treatment. In all, our data suggest that

In this study, we used the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population to identify genetic factors associated with the drug response that may inform risk management strategies for idelalisib in humans. Eight male mice (4 matched pairs) from 50 CC lines were treated once daily for 14 days by oral gavage with either vehicle or idelalisib at a dose selected to achieve clinically relevant peak plasma concentrations (150 mg/kg/day). The drug was well tolerated across all CC lines, and there were no observations of overt liver injury. Differences across CC lines were seen in drug concentration in plasma samples collected at the approximate Tmax on study Days 1, 7, and 14. There were also small but statistically significant treatment-induced alterations in plasma total bile acids and microRNA-122, and these may indicate early hepatocellular stress required for immune-mediated hepatotoxicity in humans. Idelalisib treatment further induced significant elevations in the total cell count of terminal bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which may be analogous to pneumonitis observed in the clinic. Genetic mapping identified loci associated with interim plasma idelalisib concentration and the other 3 treatment-related endpoints. Thirteen priority candidate quantitative trait genes identified in CC mice may now guide interrogation of risk factors for adverse drug responses associated with idelalisib in humans.},

Several lines of evidence indicate that interindividual variation in susceptibility to TB has a heritable component, yet we still know little about the underlying genetic architecture. To address this, we performed a genome-wide mapping study of loci that are associated with functional variation in immune response to MTB. Specifically, we characterized transcript and protein expression levels and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in primary dendritic cells (DCs) from 65 individuals, before and after infection with MTB. We found 198 response eQTL, namely loci that were associated with variation in gene expression levels in either untreated or MTB-infected DCs, but not both. These response eQTL are associated with natural regulatory variation that likely affects (directly or indirectly) host interaction with MTB. Indeed, when we integrated our data with results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for pulmonary TB, we found that the response eQTL were more likely to be genetically associated with the disease. We thus identified a number of candidate loci, including the MAPK phosphatase
              DUSP14
              in particular, that are promising susceptibility genes to pulmonary TB.},

              Genetic studies have shown that obesity risk is heritable and that, of the many common variants now associated with body mass index, those in an intron of the fat mass and obesity-associated (

The size of the UK Biobank, and its joint measurement of genetic, anthropometric and lifestyle variables, offers an unprecedented opportunity to assess gene-by-environment interactions in a way that accounts for the dependence between different factors. We jointly examine the evidence for interactions between
              FTO
              (rs1421085) and various lifestyle and environmental factors. We report interactions between the

	abstract = {"Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective. Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and references at the end of the book"--},

I show that the conditions usually cited in the literature are overly restrictive and can be relaxed substantially without compromising identification. In particular, I show that natural effects can be identified by methods that go beyond standard adjustment for confounders, applicable to observational studies in which treatment assignment remains confounded with the mediator or with the outcome. These identification conditions can be validated algorithmically from the diagrammatic description of one's model and are guaranteed to produce unbiased results whenever the description is correct. The identification conditions can be further relaxed in parametric models, possibly including interactions, and permit one to compare the relative importance of several pathways, mediated by interdependent variables.},

First, it allows researchers to incorporate prior information into the mediation analysis, thus potentially improving the efficiency of estimates. Second, under the Bayesian mediation analysis, inference is straightforward and exact, which makes it appealing for studies with small samples. Third, the Bayesian approach is conceptually simpler for multilevel mediation analysis. Simulation studies and analysis of 2 data sets are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

Moreover, although both behavior and epigenetic effects are known to be modified by perinatal environmental exposures such as nutrient deficiency, the architecture of such environment-by-POE is mostly unexplored. To study POE and environment-by-POE, we employ a relatively neglected but especially powerful experimental system for POE-detection: reciprocal F1 hybrids (RF1s). We exposed female NOD/ShiLtJ×C57Bl/6J and C57Bl/6J×NOD/ShiLtJ mice, perinatally, to one of four different diets, then after weaning recorded a set of behaviors that model psychiatric disease. Whole-brain microarray expression data revealed an imprinting-enriched set of 15 genes subject to POE. The most-significant expression POE, on the non-imprinted gene Carmil1 (a.k.a. Lrrc16a), was validated using qPCR in the same and in a new set of mice. Several behaviors, especially locomotor behaviors, also showed POE. Bayesian mediation analysis suggested Carmil1 expression suppresses behavioral POE, and that the imprinted gene Airn suppresses POE on Carmil1 expression. A suggestive diet-by-POE was observed on percent center time in the open field test, and a significant diet-by-POE was observed on one imprinted gene, Mir341, and on 16 non-imprinted genes. The relatively small, tractable set of POE and diet-by-POE detected on behavior and expression here motivates further studies examining such effects across RF1s on multiple genetic backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Causal mediation analysis aims to examine the role of a mediator or a group of mediators that lie in the pathway between an exposure and an outcome. Recent biomedical studies often involve a large number of potential mediators based on high-throughput technologies. Most of the current analytic methods focus on settings with one or a moderate number of potential mediators. With the expanding growth of -omics data, joint analysis of molecular-level genomics data with epidemiological data through mediation analysis is becoming more common. However, such joint analysis requires methods that can simultaneously accommodate high-dimensional mediators and that are currently lacking. To address this problem, we develop a Bayesian inference method using continuous shrinkage priors to extend previous causal mediation analysis techniques to a high-dimensional setting. Simulations demonstrate that our method improves the power of global mediation analysis compared to simpler alternatives and has decent performance to identify true nonnull contributions to the mediation effects of the pathway. The Bayesian method also helps us to understand the structure of the composite null cases for inactive mediators in the pathway. We applied our method to Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and identified DNA methylation regions that may actively mediate the effect of socioeconomic status on cardiometabolic outcomes.},

Almost all mediation analyses in psychology use frequentist estimation and hypothesis-testing techniques. A recent exception is Yuan and MacKinnon (Psychological Methods, 14, 301-322, 2009), who outlined a Bayesian parameter estimation procedure for mediation analysis. Here we complete the Bayesian alternative to frequentist mediation analysis by specifying a default Bayesian hypothesis test based on the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow approach. We further extend this default Bayesian test by allowing a comparison to directional or one-sided alternatives, using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques implemented in JAGS.

By using genome-wide location analysis, we examined how two different cell types generate different responses to the NF-κB signaling pathway. We showed that, after TNF-α treatment, the NF-κB p65 subunit binds to distinct genome locations and subsequently induces different subsets of genes in human monocytic THP-1 cells versus HeLa cells. Interestingly, the differential p65 binding in two cell types correlates with preexisting cell type-specific enhancers before TNF-α stimulation, marked by histone modifications. We also found that two transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBPα, appear to synergistically mediate enhancer creation and affect NF-κB target selection in THP-1 cells. In HeLa cells, coexpression of PU.1 and C/EBPα conferred TNF-α responsiveness to a subset of THP-1-specific NF-κB target genes. These results suggest that the diversity of transcriptional programs in mammalian cells arises, at least in part, from preexisting enhancers that are established by cell-specific transcription factors.},

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

Chromatin mapping during pancreatic and hepatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells revealed the en masse acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers specific to endoderm-derived cell lineages in gut tube intermediates. Experimentally, the acquisition of this poised enhancer state predicts the ability of endodermal intermediates to respond to inductive signals. Furthermore, these enhancers are first recognized by the pioneer transcription factors FOXA1 and FOXA2 when competence is acquired, while subsequent recruitment of lineage-inductive transcription factors, such as PDX1, leads to enhancer and target gene activation. Together, our results identify the acquisition of a poised chromatin state at enhancers as a mechanism by which progenitor cells acquire developmental competence.},

	abstract = {In genome-wide epigenetic studies, it is of great scientific interest to assess whether the effect of an exposure on a clinical outcome is mediated through DNA methylations. However, statistical inference for causal mediation effects is challenged by the fact that one needs to test a large number of composite null hypotheses across the whole epigenome. Two popular tests, the Wald-type Sobel's test and the joint significant test using the traditional null distribution are underpowered and thus can miss important scientific discoveries. In this paper, we show that the null distribution of Sobel's test is not the standard normal distribution and the null distribution of the joint significant test is not uniform under the composite null of no mediation effect, especially in finite samples and under the singular point null case that the exposure has no effect on the mediator and the mediator has no effect on the outcome. Our results explain why these two tests are underpowered, and more importantly motivate us to develop a more powerful Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test (DACT) for the composite null hypothesis of no mediation effect by leveraging epigenome-wide data. We adopted Efron's empirical null framework for assessing statistical significance of the DACT test. We showed analytically that the proposed DACT method had improved power, and could well control type I error rate. Our extensive simulation studies showed that, in finite samples, the DACT method properly controlled the type I error rate and outperformed Sobel's test and the joint significance test for detecting mediation effects. We applied the DACT method to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study which included men who were aged 21 to 80 years at entry. We identified multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the effect of smoking on lung function with effect sizes ranging from -0.18 to -0.79 and false discovery rate controlled at level 0.05, including the CpG sites in the genes AHRR and F2RL3. Our sensitivity analysis found small residual correlations (less than 0.01) of the error terms between the outcome and mediator regressions, suggesting that our results are robust to unmeasured confounding factors.},

Reanalyzing these data using a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, we were able to create a surprisingly high-resolution map of the typical locations of sites that affect mRNA levels in cis. Strikingly, we found a strong enrichment of eQTLs in the 250 bp just upstream of the transcription end site (TES), in addition to an enrichment around the transcription start site (TSS). Most eQTLs lie either within genes or close to genes; for example, we estimate that only 5\% of eQTLs lie more than 20 kb upstream of the TSS. After controlling for position effects, SNPs in exons are approximately 2-fold more likely than SNPs in introns to be eQTLs. Our results suggest an important role for mRNA stability in determining steady-state mRNA levels, and highlight the potential of eQTL mapping as a high-resolution tool for studying the determinants of gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction and defects in dendritic spine morphology. In the past decade, an extensive list of genes associated with ASD has been identified by genome-wide sequencing initiatives. Several of these genes functionally converge in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a conserved cascade essential for stem cell pluripotency and cell fate decisions during development. Here, we review current information regarding the transcriptional program of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ASD. First, we discuss that Wnt/β-catenin gain and loss of function studies recapitulate brain developmental abnormalities associated with ASD. Second, transcriptomic approaches using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) cells, featuring mutations in high confidence ASD genes, reveal a significant dysregulation in the expression of Wnt signaling components. Finally, we focus on the activity of chromatin-remodeling proteins and transcription factors considered high confidence ASD genes, including CHD8, ARID1B, ADNP, and TBR1, that regulate Wnt/β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity in multiple cell types, including pyramidal neurons, interneurons and oligodendrocytes, cells which are becoming increasingly relevant in the study of ASD. We conclude that the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation could explain the high phenotypical heterogeneity of ASD and be instrumental in the development of new diagnostics tools and therapies.},

              Summary
              The Genomic Data Storage (GDS) format provides efficient storage and retrieval of genotypes measured by microarrays and sequencing. We developed GENESIS to perform various single- and aggregate-variant association tests using genotype data stored in GDS format. GENESIS implements highly flexible mixed models, allowing for different link functions, multiple variance components and phenotypic heteroskedasticity. GENESIS integrates cohesively with other R/Bioconductor packages to build a complete genomic analysis workflow entirely within the R environment.

            The “marginality principle” for linear regression models states that when a higher order term is included, its constituent terms must also be included. The target article relies on this principle for the fixed-effects part of linear mixed models of ANOVA designs and considers the implication that if extended to combined fixed-and-random-effects models, model selection tests specific to some fixed-effects ANOVA terms are not possible. We review the basis for this principle for fixed-effects models and delineate its limits. We then consider its extension to combined fixed-and-random-effects models. We conclude that we have been unable to find in the literature, including the target article, and have ourselves been unable to construct any satisfactory argument against the use of incomplete ANOVA models. The only basis we could find requires one to assume that it is not possible to test point-null hypotheses, something we disagree with, and which we believe is incompatible with the Bayesian model-selection methods that are the basis of the target article.},

	abstract = {The marginality principle guides analysts to avoid omitting lower-order terms from models in which higher-order terms are included as covariates. Lower-order terms are viewed as "marginal" to higher-order terms. We consider how this principle applies to three cases: regression models that may include the ratio of two measured variables; polynomial transformations of a measured variable; and factorial arrangements of defined interventions. For each case, we show that which terms or transformations are considered to be lower-order, and therefore marginal, depends on the scale of measurement, which is frequently arbitrary. Understanding the implications of this point leads to an intuitive understanding of the curse of dimensionality. We conclude that the marginality principle may be useful to analysts in some specific cases but caution against invoking it as a context-free recipe.},

Chemicals often co-occur in the environment or in synthetic mixtures and as a result exposure levels can be highly correlated. We propose a latent factor joint model, which includes shared factors in both the predictor and response components while assuming conditional independence. By including a quadratic regression in the latent variables in the response component, we induce flexible dimension reduction in characterizing main effects and interactions. We propose a Bayesian approach to inference under this Factor analysis for INteractions (FIN) framework. Through appropriate modifications of the factor modeling structure, FIN can accommodate higher order interactions. We evaluate the performance using a simulation study and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Code is available on GitHub.},
